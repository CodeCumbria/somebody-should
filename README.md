Somebody Should
===============

Inspired wholly by DoESLiverpool's [somebody-should](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should).

A place to collect issues/suggestions/to-do items for Code Cumbria

There isn't any source code for this repo, we're just using this to track issues.

If the project you're reporting the issue under has got source code, for example, the Slack Invite https://github.com/CodeCumbria/slack-invite then raise the issue there instead.

Anyone can create new issues.  Similarly, anyone is allowed to do the work to fix them 

---

You'll find all the issues handily organised into three categories - Sustain, Needs, and Wants - according to urgency. 

 * [Sustain](https://github.com/CodeCumbria/somebody-should/labels/1%20-%20Sustain) is for issues related to the ongoing sustainability of Code Cumbria, and the things we can do to help increase visibility 
 * [Needs](https://github.com/CodeCumbria/somebody-should/labels/2%20-%20Needs) is for issues that need to be dealt with and closed as soon as possible 
 * [Wants](https://github.com/CodeCumbria/somebody-should/labels/3%20-%20Wants) is where things go when they would be a good addition to Code Cumbria, but aren't affecting anything too much by not being in place yet

If you feel like you have the ability and time to take lead on any issue, just let us know.  Better still, if the issue doesn't have anyone assigned, assign it to yourself and get on with it :-)

Use labels to mark the issues with any suitable tags, so that it's easy for someone to find all the outstanding bugs, or all the things related to the workshop, or similar.  Create new labels if there's a class of issue that we're missing.  HuBoard uses labels starting with numbers for its board buckets, so labelling something with "2 - The time is now" will assign it to that board.  If you don't know which board to assign something to, just leave off those labels, and it'll get assigned in the next triage session.

For some more background on good practice when using issues, read http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/.  It's about Github's culture and process rather than ours, but until someone gets round to writing ours...
